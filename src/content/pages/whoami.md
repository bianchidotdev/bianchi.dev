ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Bianchi

![enbyware](https://pride-badges.pony.workers.dev/static/v1?label=enbyware&labelColor=%23555&stripeWidth=8&stripeColors=FCF434%2CFFFFFF%2C9C59D1%2C2C2C2C)

Pronouns: they/them

I'm  a software engineer who builds mostly in Elixir, Ruby, and Go. Professionally, I focus largely on backend software, developer tooling, and declarative infrastructure.

My goal is typically to make applications robust and observable so when I inevitably need to pass the baton onto future engineers, they have all the tools they need to be successful.

**Interests:**
* Digital Privacy
* Homelab
* Juggling
* Modular Origami
* Rock Climbing
